# First Project | Node.js with EJS

![Preview](.github/preview.png)

```
This project was made when I had the first contact with Node.js, 
I didn't get to delve too deep into Node.js, ejs was the 
highlight in this project, because the objective was to create 
a simple page using Node.js with some tabs, without having to 
enter another page and load other content.
